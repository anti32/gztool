gztool v0.11.4

extract random positioned data from gzip files with no penalty,
including gzip tailing like with 'tail -f' ! 

By default gzip-compressed files cannot be accessed in random mode:
any byte required at position N requires the complete gzip file
to be decompressed from the beginning to the N byte.
Nonetheless Mark Adler, the author of zlib, provided years ago a
cryptic file named zran.c that creates an "index" of "windows"
filled with 32 kiB of uncompressed data at different positions
along the un/compressed file, which can be used to initialize the
zlib library and make it behave as if compressed data begin there.
